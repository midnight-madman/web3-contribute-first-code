# Intro

Welcome to Web3 Contribute First Code

We're starting with a list of open-source github projects that have tagged issues as "good first issue", "open for contribution" or similar



## What's next

In the future we can rate projects on how well they onboard new developers, advise DAOs that want to open their code to newcomers, etc.
